# How to Update Universalis

The data on Universalis is **crowdsourced**, meaning you have the power to update Universalis yourself! To contribute, install software like the [Dalamud Plugins FFXIV Quick Launcher](https://goatcorp.github.io/) or the [TeamCraft Desktop App](https://github.com/ffxiv-teamcraft/ffxiv-teamcraft/releases/latest). Once installed all you have to do is you visit the marketboard and look up items, the listings and history you see in-game of the items you look up will be sent to Universalis.

See all supported software here: [Supported Software](https://universalis.app/contribute).

## Updating Retainer Prices Does Not Update Universalis

Note that Universalis is only updated when you look up items on the marketboard. It is not updated when you change prices in your retainers. After you update prices, be sure to return to the marketboard and look up your items to ensure they get updated.

## If You Don't Update, Someone Eventually Will!

You don't have to do this all yourself! This is where the **crowdsourced** aspect becomes important. If you don't look up the items, eventually someone with the Quick Launcher or TeamCraft will look them up and update the items for you.

## How to Get Help If You Do Not Play on PC

If you do not play on PC, you cannot update Universalis yourself. If you want specific items updated, you can ask in the Universalis [Data Requests](https://discord.com/channels/616826096897228801/1192666174559891627) channel, and a PC player will assist you.
